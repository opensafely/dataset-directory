# COVID-19 Therapeutics

## Introduction
New COVID-19 therapies, antivirals and neutralising monoclonal antibodies (nMABs), were rolled out for outpatient settings in England from 20th December 2021, to reduce the risk of hospitalisation or death in patients with COVID-19. Their effectiveness and safety needs to be assessed in practice outside of trial settings, and it is important to monitor which patients are receiving such treatments and whether there is unwarranted variation. 

Patients at increased risk from COVID-19 (e.g. solid organ transplant recipients) and potentially eligible to receive these treatments, were identified nationally and notified , or identified as eligible by their healthcare team. Upon becoming infected, patients can be referred to COVID Medicine Delivery Units (CMDUs) for assessment for treatment, based on their clinical presentation and inclusion/exclusion criteria such as age and comorbidities. Each CMDU notifies NHS England of all treatment decisions, from which a COVID-19 “Therapeutics” dataset is created, detailing who has received an antiviral or nMABs, covering both inpatient and outpatient settings.
