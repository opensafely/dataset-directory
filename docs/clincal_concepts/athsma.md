## Methodological Notes
There are a number of means by which one may ascerain a patient having asthma. Those supported within OpenSAFELY are : **a**, **b**, and **c**; represented as phenotypes **x**, **y**, and **z**. Of these, **a** is generally considered the most reliable, but consideration must also be given to the effect of *p* on *q*. A combined phenotype of **has_asthma** is provided which should suffice for must purposes.

## Quality Outcomes Framework Indicators

QOF indicators pertaining to Asthma are defined by NICE as follows:

* [AST001](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/asthma/goals-outcome-measures/qof-indicators/)
>The contractor establishes and maintains a register of patients with asthma, excluding patients with asthma who have been prescribed no asthma-related drugs in the preceding 12 months
* [AST002](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/asthma/goals-outcome-measures/qof-indicators/)
>The percentage of patients aged 8 or over with asthma (diagnosed on or after 1 April 2006), on the register, with measures of variability or reversibility recorded between 3 months before and anytime after diagnosis
* [AST003](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/asthma/goals-outcome-measures/qof-indicators/)
>The percentage of patients with asthma, on the register, who have had an asthma review in the preceding 12 months that includes an assessment of asthma control using the 3 RCP questions
* [AST004](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/asthma/goals-outcome-measures/qof-indicators/)
>The percentage of patients with asthma aged 14 or over who have not attained the age of 20, on the register, in whom there is a record of smoking status in the preceding 12 months


Measurement of these indicators within OpenSAFELY has been performed in [this study]()
